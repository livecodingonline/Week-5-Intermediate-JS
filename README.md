## Week-5-Intermediate-JS
Dear Student of LiveCoding. Welcome to the 5th week of LiveCoding!

In this section the whole videos are only 1 hour. This is a looott less in comparison to the section before. Why?

Because it is not enough if you undertstand that concepts without playing with them. That's why you have an extra time to absorb(this is important) these concepts. Understanding them is not enough per se. You need to be able to play around them easily and feel comfortable.
